you can do:

```pip install IMGPyEdit``` <- not yet implemented.

or you can download it here from this repo.


what's so special?

this software allows you to create addons for it, which can utilize other addons in their own scripts.
so if you have a fancy dents plugin and a fancy noise plugin you can make a third plugin combining the two with ease!

at the moment it's very simple, and should also work on a wide variety of systems.

usage: 
simply launch and create a new file. 
click on the buttons and use the console to change parameters such as colouration,
or the current tool being used.

forewarning; not all of these are implemented yet:
supports:

Layers,

Layer renaming,

a saving and exporting feature,

different brushes,

chaining addons,

rescaling image resolution in realtime.

=================================================================================================================
This project is cancelled.

Github locks developers out of their accounts, demands phone numbers and other data from them to get back in, and uses developers public/private repos to train LLMs. This is enough reason for me to leave the platform.

I won't support microsoft, I won't support the elimination of privacy, I won't give them free code anymore just so they can stab me in the back, and I hope they go belly up some day.

fuck micrococks, i'm out peace.

So I cancelled a ton of my projects, goodbye.
